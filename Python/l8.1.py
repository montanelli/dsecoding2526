"""Play Wordle with Python. Object-oriented version."""

# https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

# Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position

# rules
## You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less
## Every word you enter must be an English word, presumably it should exists on a dictionary.
## A correct letter turns green
## A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow
## An incorrect letter turns gray
## Letters can be used more than once

# pay attention to:
## handle guessed word not existing or with lenght not equal to 5
## repeated guess by the user does not consume additional attempts

# we need a set of english words
