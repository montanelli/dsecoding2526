# build a list of sales by branch
# build a list of lists where each row is about a branch in unique_branches
# each row contains the list of sales of the branch in unique_branches with the same index
# consider A, B, C as branches in unique_branches
# sales will contain three items and each item is a list of sales
# the 1st item of sales is the list of sales of A, and so on...
