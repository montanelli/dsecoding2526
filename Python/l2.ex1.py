# write a program that takes a fiscal code in input. The code is formatted as follows:
## ABCDEF99B12
# first 3 chars -> lastname (ABC)
# next 3 chars -> firstname (DEF)
# next 2 chars -> birth year (99)
# next 1 chars -> letter of the month (A:JAN, B:FEB, ...)
# next 2 chars -> day of birth (12)
#Â the program has to extract the code parts and returns a readable text

firstname = cf[3:6]

print("Lastname:", lastname)
